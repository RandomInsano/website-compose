# Edwin's Adventures in Docker Compose

I like Docker and had a need to set up a PHP-based website for a friend. What better time to play around with Docker Compose?!

The dabbling that I've done has given my a Let's Encrypt secured host.

### To do

* Allow Let's Encrypt setup without needing to uncomment parts of the nginx config
* Automatically redirect from 80 to 443
